# Prompt Engineering Manifesto
It is easy for AI to be used for practically anything to everything related to software engineering. The following are guidelines for programmers to remain self-improving and efficient as opposed to solely floating on vibes.

## When to use AI
* **Without code as context**
  * Asking high-level questions  <span title="If code changes are provided in response, use as a reference or make the updates yourself, as opposed to allowing the IDE to make updates for you. The act of going line by line keeps your critical thinking hat on & presents the opportunity to pursue questions along the way.">ℹ️</span>
    * What package(s) are recommended for {task}
    * Describe how to {task}
    * Explain {concept}
    * etc.
* **With code as context** <span title="Always review outputs for potential corrections or to catch logic errors that may be presented.">ℹ️</span>
  * Code reviews & refactoring <span title="Asking if something can be done in a more readable or efficient way may be a good learning opportunity.">ℹ️</span>
  * Generating documentation or specs

## When not to use AI
* The first attempt at solving a problem or implementing code
* Implementing code using uncommon methodologies <span title="As of now (2025), LLMs operate on pre-existing data sets & lack the skill of free thinking. Uncommon logic may lead to partially accurate responses.">ℹ️</span>
